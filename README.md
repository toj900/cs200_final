Hangman Game
This project is a terminal based hangman game, which will implement the following:

The purpose of this group assignment is to use all the knowledge and best practices learned in this course and apply it towards creating a software application. Another objective of this assignment is to also gain skills in working as members of a team. In the real-world, software creation is rarely a one man show. Several groups of software engineers, programmers, system architects, database administrators, software testers etc. work together to create a piece of software.

 

Pick a scenario with your teammates, a game, a real-world scenario from your job or something else you are interested in etc., and design and implement the code in C++. The following 10 requirements should be present in your code:

 

At least 4 classes
Inheritance & Composition/Aggregation
Abstract class(es)
Pure virtual function(s)
Dynamic binding
Operator overloading
STL algorithm(s)
STL iterator(s)
STL container(s)
Exception handling
 

 

You already have an idea of what this project entails, from your experience with your last Bank Application IV assignment. Your application can either interact with the user through the console or read information from a file(s). Make sure your code is appropriately commented.

 

Once you are done you will need to create documentation which contains the following sections:

Purpose of this application. Explain the scenario.
User’s Manual (explain how the user should interact with your program)
Explain how you fulfilled each of the above 10 requirements in your program (if you did not implement a requirement, please note this!). EACH REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE CLEARLY NOTED IN BOLD IN YOUR DOCUMENT.
UML class diagram with all classes and their relationships.
Explain what errors you encountered in the analysis or development process.
Reflection on your team collaboration in creating this assignment (any challenges you encountered or what worked well)
 

During Week 16 each team will present the group project to the class. Each group will have about 10-15 min.

Please submit two files:

A single .cpp file with all your code. Although it is best practice to use a separate .h and .cpp for each class, please include all your code in a single .cpp file when you submit (make sure it compiles and runs properly!,) so it is easier for me to grade.
A Word document with the documentation explained above.
